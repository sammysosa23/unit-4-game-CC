Crystal Collector

An interactive web game that updates the HTML with a jQuery library.

HOW IT WORKS!

- There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. 

- The player will be shown a "Magic Number" at teh start of the game.

- When the player clicks on a crystal it will add points to the players "Total Score."

- The game will hide the amount of each crystal until the player clicks a crystal. 

- When the player clicks on a crystal the app will update the players score.

- The player wins if their total score matches the "Magic Number" at the top of the browser.

- The player losses if their score goes over the "Magic Number."

- The game will automatically restart after the win/lose with a new "Magic Number." The crystals will also have four new hidden values.

- The browswer will also show you the number of games the player has won or lose.

HAVE FUN! ENJOY!
